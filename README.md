## 🧠 Architecture Overview

QuickBite is structured into **three isolated logical layers**, with **clean routing** and **template inheritance**:

```
Users ↔ Flask Routes ↔ Templates (Jinja2)
     ↕               ↕
Local JSON Files  ⟷ Static Uploads
```

- No cloud database used — all user data, menu items, and orders are stored locally in JSON format.
- Images are stored in local folders (`/static/uploads` and `/static/logos`).
- Flask `session` handles secure authentication and role tracking.
- Code is modular and split by role: `user`, `admin`, and `superadmin`.
